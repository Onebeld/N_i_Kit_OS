# N_i_Kit_OS

A project developed within the university (RSVPU). This is a Telegram chatbot that allows you to check sites for traffic, security, transmission and so on, written in Rust.

Originally we wanted to write in Python, but I got bored and we decided to do it in Rust. In general, we made the code in Python as a demo.

The project was made in collaboration with [N-i-Kit-OS](https://github.com/N-i-Kit-OS), my fellow student (in fact, the code name of the project was his idea).
